After you finish a set of annotations you can save them to further use 
in the restoration processing. You can do this by clicking the `save` 
button in the toolbar. 

This will open a dialog that allows you to save the annotations to a
JSON file or copy it to the clipboard after properly filling a form 
with the image metadata and the annotations metadata.

Suppose you have the following annotations:

import SaveAlert from '@/components/SaveAlert.astro'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import single from '../../../assets/save-annot/single-annot.png'
import trio from '../../../assets/save-annot/trio-annot.png'

<div className='flex flex-row gap-1 justify-center items-center'>
    <Image className='w-44 rounded-md shadow-lg border border-accent' src={single} alt='Single annotation' />
    <Image className='w-44 rounded-md shadow-lg border border-accent' src={trio} alt='Trio annotation'  />
</div>

You may try to save them by clicking the `save` button above.

<SaveAlert/>

:::caution[Invalid annotations!]
You cannot save annotations if they do not form a valid set of *pairs*.
This means that you must not have any *single* points or more than *two* 
points of the same color, i.e., you must get rid of all the points 
circled by a **ring** marker and all the **X** markers.
