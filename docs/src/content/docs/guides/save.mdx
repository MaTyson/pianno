import { SaveIcon } from 'lucide-react';

Upon completion of a set of annotations, saving them for future use
in the restoration processing is possible. This can be achieved by
clicking the `save` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'>
<SaveIcon className='self-center w-5 h-5'/></span> button in the toolbar.

This will open a dialog that allows you to save the annotations to a
JSON file or copy it to the clipboard after properly filling a form
with both the image metadata and the annotations metadata.

Suppose you have the following annotations:

import SaveAlert from '@/components/SaveAlert.astro'
import Save from '@/components/Save.astro'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import single from '../../../assets/save-annot/single-annot.png';
import trio from '../../../assets/save-annot/trio-annot.png';

<div className="flex flex-row items-center justify-center gap-1">
  <Image
    className="w-44 rounded-md border border-accent shadow-lg"
    src={single}
    alt="Single annotation"
  />
  <Image
    className="w-44 rounded-md border border-accent shadow-lg"
    src={trio}
    alt="Trio annotation"
  />
</div>

You may try to save them by clicking the `save` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'>
<SaveIcon className='self-center w-5 h-5'/></span> button below.

<SaveAlert />

:::caution[Invalid annotations!]
Annotations cannot be saved unless they constitute a valid set of 
pairs. This implies the absence of singular points or the presence 
of more than two points of identical color. In other words, it is 
necessary to eliminate all points encircled by a **ring** marker and 
all **X** markers.
