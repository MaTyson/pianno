Upon completion of a set of annotations, saving them for future use 
in the restoration processing is possible. This can be achieved by 
clicking the `save` button in the toolbar.

This will open a dialog that allows you to save the annotations to a
JSON file or copy it to the clipboard after properly filling a form 
with both the image metadata and the annotations metadata.

Suppose you have the following annotations:

import SaveAlert from '@/components/SaveAlert.astro'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import single from '../../../assets/save-annot/single-annot.png'
import trio from '../../../assets/save-annot/trio-annot.png'

<div className='flex flex-row gap-1 justify-center items-center'>
    <Image className='w-44 rounded-md shadow-lg border border-accent' src={single} alt='Single annotation' />
    <Image className='w-44 rounded-md shadow-lg border border-accent' src={trio} alt='Trio annotation'  />
</div>

You may try to save them by clicking the `save` button below.

<SaveAlert/>

:::caution[Invalid annotations!]
Annotations cannot be saved unless they constitute a valid set of 
pairs. This implies the absence of singular points or the presence 
of more than two points of identical color. In other words, it is 
necessary to eliminate all points encircled by a **ring** marker and all
 **X** markers.
