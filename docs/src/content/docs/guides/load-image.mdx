import { ImageIcon } from 'lucide-react';

In order to start annotating your images, you need to load them into the app. 
You can do this by clicking the `Load Image` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'>
<ImageIcon className='self-center w-4 h-4'/></span> button in the app toolbar, whose 
simplified representation is shown below. This will open a dialog that allows
you to select a `.png` or `.raw/.b` file from your computer, provided that you have 
*filled correctly* the metadata fields for the `raw` images. 

## Go ahead and try it out!


import LoadImage from '@/components/LoadImage.astro'

<LoadImage />

:::note

This is a simplified representation of the load image button, therefore it does not
actually load any image.
