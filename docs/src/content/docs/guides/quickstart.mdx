Pianno is the short form of **Pi**mega **Anno**tator, an 
auxiliar tool for the process of alignment of modules and stripes 
of the Pimega detectors' images. 

With Pianno one can annotate points in the images and export them for
latter use in the alignment process. It is necessary to select pairs 
of points in such a way that, for a pair **p** and **q**, one of three possible 
constraints is satisfied:

- Horizontal alignment ( the x coordinate of **p** is the same as the
 x coordinate of **q** )
- Vertical alignment ( the y coordinate of **p** is the same as the
 y coordinate of **q** )
- Euclidean alignment ( the distance between **p** and **q** satisfies
 a known value )

 ## Accessing Pianno

 The Pianno application is available in the following link:
 [Pianno](https:/example.com/)

 No installation or download is required, just access the link and
    start using it.

## Using Pianno

The annotation process is divided in three main steps:

1. Load the image to be annotated by clicking the `Load Image` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'><ImageIcon className='self-center w-4 h-4'/></span>
button. A simple demo is displayed below:

<LoadImage/>

2. Start annotating pairs of points on the loaded image using the `pen` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'><PenIcon className='self-center w-4 h-4'/></span>
 tool. The `eraser` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'><EraserIcon className='self-center w-4 h-4'/></span> tool can be useful in case of missannotation. It is 
 very intuitive to use, just select a color corresponding to the type
 of alignment of the pair of points you intend to annotate and click on
 the image to paint the pixel marked on the cursor.

3. Export the annotations to a JSON file by clicking the `save` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'>
<SaveIcon className='self-center w-4 h-4'/></span> button. Then,
 one must fill a quick form with both the image metadata and 
 the annotations metadata. This file serves as input for the alignment
 process. A simple demo is displayed below:
