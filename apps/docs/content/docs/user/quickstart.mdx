## Accessing <span className="font-mono text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">pianno</span>

The <span className="font-mono text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">pianno</span> application is available for internal use in the LNLS network at
[https://pianno.lnls.br](https://pianno.lnls.br)

No installation or download is required, just access the link and
start using it.

## Running <span className="font-mono text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">pianno</span> locally

To run <span className="font-mono text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">pianno</span> locally, one must have the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This will start a development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and a docs server at [http://localhost:4321/uwu](http://localhost:4321/uwu).

There is also docker images available for the application and the docs, which can be run with the following commands:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the docs at [http://localhost:4321/uwu](http://localhost:4321/uwu).

Or you can use the pre-built images available at the repository's registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cnpem/cnpem/pianno:main
docker pull ghcr.io/cnpem/cnpem/pianno-docs:main
```

And then run the images with:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/cnpem/cnpem/pianno:main
docker run -p 4321:3000 ghcr.io/cnpem/cnpem/pianno-docs:main
```

This will start the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the docs at [http://localhost:4321/uwu](http://localhost:4321/uwu).

<Callout title='Careful with the base paths!' type="warn">
  Notice that the docs are served under the `/uwu` base path, so the `/` path will not lead to any content.
</Callout>

## Using <span className="font-mono text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">pianno</span>

The annotation process is divided in three main steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
Load the image to be annotated by clicking the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">Load image<ImageIcon className='w-4 h-4'/></span>
   button.
    <Load />
</Step>

<Step>
  Start annotating pairs of points on the loaded image using the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">pen <PenIcon className="w-4 h-4" /></span> tool. 
  The <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">eraser<EraserIcon className="w-4 h-4" /></span>
  tool can be useful in case of missannotation. It is very intuitive to use, just
  select a color corresponding to the type of alignment of the pair of points you
  intend to annotate and click on the image to paint the pixel marked on the cursor.
</Step>
<Step>
  Export the annotations to a JSON file by clicking the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">save <SaveIcon className="w-4 h-4" /></span>
  button. 
  <SaveTool />
  Then, one must fill a quick form with both the image metadata and the annotations
  metadata. This file serves as input for the alignment process.
  <SaveForm />
</Step>
