import { PenIcon, EraserIcon } from 'lucide-react';

The annotation process consists of using the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">pen <PenIcon className="w-4 h-4" /></span> tool to mark pairs of points on the image that should be used to correct it's alignment.

For a pair of points **p** and **q**, there are three types of annotations that can be made:

- Horizontal alignment ( the x coordinate of **p** is the same as the
  x coordinate of **q** )
- Vertical alignment ( the y coordinate of **p** is the same as the
  y coordinate of **q** )
- Euclidean alignment ( the distance between **p** and **q** satisfies
  a known value )

To differentiate between these types of annotations, the user can select and create colors for
each type of annotation in the `Color Picker` menu.


## Creating an annotation

To create an annotation, the user must first select the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">pen <PenIcon className="w-4 h-4" /></span>
tool and a color for the type of annotation they want to create.

With a color selected, the user can click on the image to create a point of that color. The user can click on
the image again, a second point will be created with the same color.

If the `Preview Mode` is enabled, the user will see a line connecting the two points and markers around
the points indicating the type of annotation that will be created.

If there are more than two points of the same color, the user will see a line connecting
the last two points and other markers indicating the points that should be erased before saving.
There are three types of markers that can be displayed in the `Preview Mode`:

- Annotation points ( the points that will be used to create the annotation )
- Single points ( when just one point of a color is created )
- Extra points ( when there are more than two points of the same color )

Single points are displayed as a circle around the point, Extra points are displayed as a X over the point,
and Annotation points have a line connecting them and three markers around them indicating the type of annotation
that will be created:

- Horizontal alignment: a triangle pointing sideways in the direction of the other point of the annotation
- Vertical alignment: a triangle pointing up or down in the direction of the other point of the annotation
- Euclidean alignment: a circle around the point

Before saving, the user needs to erase points manually by selecting the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">eraser<EraserIcon className="w-4 h-4" /></span> tool.
