description: Save your annotations to JSON.

import { SaveIcon } from 'lucide-react';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import { SaveTool, SaveForm } from "@/components/save";

Upon completion of a set of annotations, saving them for future use
in the restoration processing is possible. This can be achieved by
clicking the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">save <SaveIcon className="w-4 h-4" /></span> button in the toolbar.

<SaveTool />

This will open a dialog that allows you to save the annotations to a
JSON file or copy it to the clipboard after properly filling a form
with both the image metadata and the annotations metadata.

<SaveForm />

<Callout title="Invalid annotations!" type="warn">
Annotations cannot be saved unless they constitute a valid set of 
pairs. This implies the absence of singular points or the presence 
of more than two points of identical color. In other words, it is 
necessary to eliminate all points encircled by a **ring** marker and 
all **X** markers.
</Callout>

## The form

After correcting the annotations you will be asked to fill a form with
the image metadata and the annotations metadata, which are:

- Device name (e.g. `pi135D`)
- Device id (identifier referring to the beamline, e.g. `#3`)
- Geometry (e.g. `planar`)
- Distance for the measured image (in mm), only used for nonplanar 
devices. For planar devices, `0` can be used

For each pair of annotations, you will be asked to provide / confirm:

- a known euclidean distance (pixel unit) between the two points. For
*horizontal* and *vertical* annotations, `-1` is preferred
- the type of the pair of annotations (e.g. `horizontal`)

Finally, you will be able to save the annotations to a JSON file or
copy them to the clipboard by clicking the corresponding button.

## JSON Format

The JSON format of the annotations is the following:

```json
{   
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",
    "device": {
        "name": "piXYZD",
        "id": "number",
        "geometry": "geometry",
        "distance": "number"
    },
    "annotations": [
        {
            "type": "type",
            "distance": "number",
            "points": [
                {
                    "x": "x1",
                    "y": "y1"
                },
                {
                    "x": "x2",
                    "y": "y2"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
