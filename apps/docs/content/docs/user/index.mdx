<span className="font-mono text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">pianno</span>
is the short form of **Pi**mega **Anno**tator, an auxiliar tool for the process of
alignment of modules and stripes of the Pimega detectors' images.

With <span className="font-mono text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">pianno</span> one can annotate points in the images and export them for
latter use in the alignment process. It is necessary to select pairs
of points in such a way that, for a pair **p** and **q**, one of three possible
constraints is satisfied:

- Horizontal alignment ( the x coordinate of **p** is the same as the
  x coordinate of **q** )
- Vertical alignment ( the y coordinate of **p** is the same as the
  y coordinate of **q** )
- Euclidean alignment ( the distance between **p** and **q** satisfies
  a known value )

The user guide is divided in the following sections:
