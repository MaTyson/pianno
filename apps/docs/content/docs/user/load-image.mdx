import { ImageIcon } from 'lucide-react';

import Load from "@/components/load";

In order to start annotating your images, you need to load them into the app. 
You can do this by clicking the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">Load image<ImageIcon className='w-4 h-4'/></span> button in the app toolbar, whose 
simplified representation is shown below. This will open a dialog that allows
you to select a `.png` or `.raw/.b` file from your computer, provided that you have 
*filled correctly* the metadata fields for the `raw` images. 

<Load/>

<Callout>
This is a simplified representation of the load image button, therefore it does not
actually load any image.
</Callout>
