import Load from "@/components/load";

In order to start annotating your images, you need to load them into the app.
You can do this by clicking the <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 rounded-md bg-muted px-1 ">Load image<ImageIcon className='w-4 h-4'/></span>
button in the app toolbar. This will open a dialog that allows you to select a `.png` or `.raw/.b` file from your computer, provided that you have
_filled correctly_ the metadata fields for the `raw` images.

The expected metadata for the `raw` images is the following:

- `Width` and `Height` of the image in pixels.
- `Data type` of the image, which can be `int32`, `float32`, or `float64`. On load the image will be converted to `uint8` for visualization.

A replica of the load button is shown below:

<Load />

<Callout>
  It is very important to load an image ready for annotation, as the tool does
  not have any image editing features. So make sure to load an image that has
  good contrast, as the annotation process relies on the user's ability to
  distinguish the points. For 450D images, the user must rotate the image's
  modules to the correct orientation before loading it as well.
</Callout>

For example, the image below is a good candidate for annotation:
![Good image for annotation](/assets/example.png)
