import { SaveIcon } from 'lucide-react';

Upon completion of a set of annotations, saving them for future use
in the restoration processing is possible. This can be achieved by
clicking the `save` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'>
<SaveIcon className='self-center w-4 h-4'/></span> button in the toolbar.

This will open a dialog that allows you to save the annotations to a
JSON file or copy it to the clipboard after properly filling a form
with both the image metadata and the annotations metadata.

Suppose you have the following annotations:

import SaveAlert from '@/components/SaveAlert.astro'
import Save from '@/components/Save.astro'
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import single from '../../../assets/save-annot/single-annot.png';
import trio from '../../../assets/save-annot/trio-annot.png';

<div className="flex flex-row items-center justify-center gap-1">
  <Image
    className="w-44 rounded-md border border-accent shadow-lg"
    src={single}
    alt="Single annotation"
  />
  <Image
    className="w-44 rounded-md border border-accent shadow-lg"
    src={trio}
    alt="Trio annotation"
  />
</div>

You may try to save them by clicking the `save` <span className='inline-flex items-baseline'>
<SaveIcon className='self-center w-4 h-4'/></span> button below.

<SaveAlert />

:::caution[Invalid annotations!]
Annotations cannot be saved unless they constitute a valid set of 
pairs. This implies the absence of singular points or the presence 
of more than two points of identical color. In other words, it is 
necessary to eliminate all points encircled by a **ring** marker and 
all **X** markers.
:::

## After Corrections

After correcting the annotations, you may try to save them by clicking
the `save` button below. Then, you will be asked to fill the form with
the image metadata and the annotations metadata, which are:

- Device name (e.g. `pi135D`)
- Device id (identifier referring to the beamline, e.g. `#3`)
- Geometry (e.g. `planar`)
- Distance for the measured image (in mm), only used for nonplanar 
devices. For planar devices, `0` can be used

For each pair of annotations, you will be asked to provide / confirm:

- a known euclidean distance (pixel unit) between the two points. For
*horizontal* and *vertical* annotations, `-1` is preferred
- the type of the pair of annotations (e.g. `horizontal`)

Finally, you will be able to save the annotations to a JSON file or
copy them to the clipboard by clicking the corresponding button.

### Try it out!
For the next example, we will assume the following pair of annotations:
<ul>
    <li className='text-[#e57373]'> {'vertical -> (0 0) - (10 10)'}</li>
    <li className='text-[#42a5f5]'> {'horizontal -> (120 190) - (110 210)'}</li>
    <li className='text-[#4caf50]'> {'euclidean -> (20 120) - (110 120)'}</li>    
</ul>

> Note that we used the following notation to denote the pairs:
>    ```latex
>    type -> (x1 y1) - (x2 y2)
>    ```

<Save/>

:::note
Since this is a *demo*, the annotations are not saved anywhere and the
canvas preview is not added to the dialog. So, by clicking the `search`
button of each pair, you will only get an alert with the corresponding
points coordinates instead of actually snapping to the corresponding 
points in the canvas.

## JSON Format

The JSON format of the annotations is the following:

```json
{   
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",
    "device": {
        "name": "piXYZD",
        "id": "#N",
        "geometry": "geometry",
        "distance": "number"
    },
    "annotations": [
        {
            "type": "type",
            "distance": "number",
            "points": [
                {
                    "x": "x1",
                    "y": "y1"
                },
                {
                    "x": "x2",
                    "y": "y2"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
